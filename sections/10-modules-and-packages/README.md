# Modules and Packages â€“ Modules, Crates, Cargo, Visibility

## Overview
Modules and packages organize Rust code into reusable units. A package is a collection of crates, where a crate is the smallest compilable unit. Modules declare namespaces within a crate and control visibility using the `pub` keyword. Cargo orchestrates building, testing, and publishing crates.

## Detailed Explanation
### Crates and Packages
A crate can be a binary or library. Packages specify one or more crates in a `Cargo.toml` file. Cargo compiles each crate separately and links them together. The root of a binary crate is usually `src/main.rs`, while a library crate has `src/lib.rs`.

### Modules
Modules allow you to group items (functions, structs, enums) into a namespace. By default, everything is private; adding `pub` exposes items to other modules or crates. Modules can be nested in subdirectories using `mod` declarations.

### Visibility
`pub` makes an item public to other modules or crates, `pub(crate)` restricts it to the current crate, and `pub(super)` exposes it to the parent module. Controlling visibility helps maintain encapsulation and prevents unintended dependencies.

## Code Examples
```rust
// src/main.rs
mod network; // declares a submodule in src/network.rs

fn main() {
    network::connect();
}
```

```rust
// src/network.rs
pub fn connect() {
    println!("connected");
}
```

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "my_app"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

## Common Pitfalls & Warnings
- **Forgetting `mod`**: Declaring a module requires a corresponding `mod` statement, or the file will not be compiled.
- **Overexposing internals**: Be mindful of what you mark `pub` to avoid a brittle API surface.

## Best Practices
- Keep modules small and focused; create submodules for separate concerns.
- Use `cargo doc --open` to generate and review documentation for your crates.

## Mini Exercise
Create a binary crate with a module named `greetings` that exposes a public function `hello()` returning a `String`. Call this function from `main` and print the result.
